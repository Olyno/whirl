# Whirl

## What does this fork include?

Many changes have been made to this fork, including:
 - removing the ``node-sass`` module and replacing it with ``sass``
 - The removal of deprecated methods
 - Fixed some animations
 - Fixed some incompatibilities between different dev OS

I plan to take care of the project during my free time, and merge the different pull requests from the main repository. I will also try to push the project further by adding CLIs to create custom animations.

Feel free to leave a star to support the project ‚≠ê

## CSS loading animations with minimal effort!

[![Whirl](/.github/images/demo.gif)](/.github/images/demo.gif)

`whirl` is a curation of CSS loading animations(whirls! üòÖ). It started as a drop in `CSS` file to get easy animations using `:pseudo` elements. It's now a collection of loading animations to use, take inspiration from, change and do what you want with üëç

### No CSS distro?

It's inefficient. It's likely an app will only use one or two loaders. Pulling them all into an app would be overkill. Most projects use some form of bundling making it possible to import a single loader's styles.

### Usage

You can install `whirl` and import the styles you want. You get both CSS and SASS files üëç

```shell
npm i @olyno/whirl
yarn add @olyno/whirl
```

## Buy me a ko-fi

Whether you use this project, have learned something from it, or just like it, please consider supporting it by buying me a coffee, so I can dedicate more time on open-source projects like this üòâ (personally I prefer hot chocolate but whatever)
